Unfortunately, I did not have support for a database on the software, and also forgot my university account has expired so I cannot use that one either, so have not been able to implement one. However, I have included the code for it and where it would be needed and used for you to see how I would have implemented one.

All of the issues I came across I would be happy to discuss and talk you through when we are able to speak again.
